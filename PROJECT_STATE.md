## Current status

**Phase:** Chunk 4 complete. Awaiting review before Chunk 5.

- ✅ Requirements gathered
- ✅ Architecture written → [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ✅ **Chunk 1 complete** — policy stacking engine
- ✅ **Chunk 2 complete** — enrollment, device PKI, mTLS auth
- ✅ **Chunk 3 complete** — desired-state protocol, signed bundles, command queue
- ✅ **Chunk 4 complete** — content-addressed artifacts, APK/XAPK pipeline,
  resumable device download. 168 tests passing.
- ⏸️ **Blocked on approval** to begin Chunk 5

Chunks 1–3 plus the Docker stack are pushed to `origin/main`.

> **Before Chunk 5:** R1 and R6 remain unanswered and Chunk 5 is built directly on
> them. The agent's file-push and install paths are the things they govern. One
> session with an XCover6 Pro pointed at the running Docker stack settles both.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|---|---|
| Management mode | Android **Device Owner** (not managed enterprise / not work profile) |
| App source | Sideloaded APK / XAPK. **No managed Google Play.** |
| Primary hardware | Samsung; full Knox integration intended — see device matrix below |
| OS target | **One UI 8 / Android 16 (API 36)** on both models |
| Connectivity | Intermittent / offline-tolerant — devices dark for hours to days |
| Fleet size | 50-500 devices |
| Scope | Generic MDM core, with TAK/ATAK as a layered policy pack |
| Hosting | Self-hosted on a single server |
| Code style | SOLID (CLAUDE.md §5) |

### Device matrix (confirmed 2026-08-30)

| Model | Device | SoC | ABI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SM-G736U1` | Galaxy XCover6 Pro (US unlocked) | Snapdragon 778G (Qualcomm) | arm64-v8a | Rugged enterprise line. **Programmable XCover/Top key** — KSP-configurable, natural ATAK PTT binding. POGO dock, removable battery. Shipped Android 12, now on One UI 8. |
| `SM-X828U` | Galaxy Tab S10+ (US carrier) | Dimensity 9300+ (MediaTek) | arm64-v8a | 12.4" WQXGA+, 5G, S Pen, IP68. Shipped Android 14, now on One UI 8. |

Both are Knox-capable enterprise-line devices (KME, KPE, E-FOTA eligible). Single
ABI across the fleet — no ABI-split complexity in the artifact model, though the
mixed Qualcomm/MediaTek SoC vendors mean firmware-level behavior must be verified
on **both** models, never just one.

**External dependency:** Samsung Knox partner/developer application is *pending*.
KME and KPE licensing are gated on it. The AOSP path must be fully functional
without Knox; Knox is strictly additive.

## Decisions made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Policies are **typed, single-concern, and stackable** via ranked assignments to device / group / tag | The core requirement — matches Hexnode's model, avoids monolithic one-policy-fits-all |
| D2 | Policy versions are **immutable once published** | Required to answer "what was actually on that device in March" during an incident |
| D3 | Merge strategy is declared as **Pydantic field metadata** | Schema *is* the merge contract; the two cannot drift out of sync |
| D4 | **Provenance on every resolved field**, from the first commit | Makes stacking debuggable rather than mysterious; cannot be retrofitted |
| D5 | **Desired-state reconciliation**, not a command stream | A device offline three weeks must converge, not replay a 500-command ordered backlog |
| D6 | Transient one-shots (reboot/lock/wipe/locate) keep a small TTL'd imperative queue | These genuinely are commands, not state |
| D7 | FCM is a **doorbell only**; correctness rests on polling | No hard push dependency given the offline requirement |
| D8 | Artifacts are **content-addressed by sha256**, downloaded direct from object storage with `Range` | Dedupe, integrity, resumable downloads on bad links |
| D9 | Policy bundles are **Ed25519-signed** independent of TLS | Cheap now; enables future LAN-relay / offline delivery with no redesign |
| D10 | Device identity is a **hardware-backed keypair + mTLS client cert**, not a bearer token | No token expiry while a device is dark for a month |
| D11 | Knox via **KSP + `setApplicationRestrictions`** primary, Knox SDK selectively | Reaches Knox breadth *without* managed Google Play — matches the sideload constraint |
| D12 | All OEM code behind an `OemPolicyApplier` interface with an AOSP no-op impl | Highest-risk seam; DIP applied where it actually pays |
| D13 | **XAPK unpacked server-side** into base + splits as separate artifacts | Server can validate package/version/signature at upload; less device CPU and storage |
| D14 | Stack: FastAPI + Postgres/SQLAlchemy 2.0/Alembic + MinIO + Postgres job table | 50-500 devices does not justify Celery or a CDN |

## Chunk plan

### ✅ Chunk 1 — Policy stacking engine (COMPLETE)

Server-side only, fully testable with zero devices.

1. ✅ SQLAlchemy 2.0 models + Alembic scaffolding → [app/db/models.py](app/db/models.py),
   [alembic/](alembic/). `alembic check` reports no drift; upgrade/downgrade round-trips.
2. ✅ Policy type registry with merge strategy declared as Pydantic field metadata →
   [app/policies/registry.py](app/policies/registry.py),
   [app/policies/specs/](app/policies/specs/). Types: `PASSWORD`, `RESTRICTIONS`, `APP_CATALOG`.
3. ✅ Pure resolver → [app/policies/resolver.py](app/policies/resolver.py),
   strategies in [app/policies/strategies.py](app/policies/strategies.py).
4. ✅ 27 resolver tests + 31 API tests → [tests/](tests/). All 58 pass.
5. ✅ REST API → [app/api/routers/](app/api/routers/), including
   `effective-policy`, `explain/{type}/{field}`, and `preview`.
6. ✅ Cache + invalidation + monotonic `state_version` →
   [app/services/effective_policy.py](app/services/effective_policy.py).

**Exit criteria met.** Stacked policies merge correctly, every field traces to its
source, conflicts are reported, and preview diffs a change before publish.

#### Decisions taken during implementation

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D15 | Invalidation marks the cache row **stale** rather than deleting it | The retained payload is the baseline needed to tell a real change from a cosmetic one. Deleting it made every invalidation look like a change — caught by test, see changelog. |
| D16 | A never-computed device baselines at `{}`, not `None` | Otherwise its first read registers as a change and bumps `state_version` spuriously. |
| D17 | `state_version` compares **values only**, excluding provenance | A policy rename changes provenance but nothing the device should act on. |
| D18 | Explicit `null` in a spec is treated as unset | A null must not drag a merged value down to nothing. |
| D19 | Registry raises at import time if a field lacks exactly one `Merge` annotation | Adding a field and forgetting its merge rule would otherwise silently produce a field that never composes. |
| D20 | Archived policies and disabled assignments stop applying but are never deleted | Preserves the history of what a device once had. |

### ✅ Chunk 2 — Enrollment and device identity (COMPLETE)

Turns an anonymous factory-reset tablet into a device the server can recognise
cryptographically, and lands it in the right policy stack from Chunk 1 on arrival.

1. **Enrollment tokens** — model + service. Secret stored hashed, with TTL, max
   uses, and revocation. Scoped to groups/tags so an enrolling device inherits its
   policy stack immediately rather than needing a second manual step.
2. **Internal CA** — generate or load an EC P-256 root; sign device CSRs. EC because
   Android Keystore and Samsung StrongBox handle it natively.
3. **Enrollment endpoint** — token + CSR + device attributes → device record, signed
   client certificate, CA chain, and server config.
4. **mTLS device authentication** — a dependency that verifies the proxy-forwarded
   client certificate against our CA (chain, validity window, revocation) and
   resolves it to a `Device`.
5. **Provisioning payloads** — QR JSON for Device Owner setup-wizard enrollment, and
   a Knox Mobile Enrollment profile payload.
6. **Authenticated check-in stub** — returns `state_version`, proving the Chunk 1
   policy engine and Chunk 2 identity connect. The full desired-state protocol is
   Chunk 3.
7. **Tests** — token lifecycle, CSR signing, re-enrollment, revocation, auth rejection.

**Exit criteria met.** A device presenting a valid enrollment token and a CSR
receives a client certificate, lands in its assigned groups/tags with its policy
stack already resolved, and authenticates a check-in by mTLS.

Delivered: [app/security/ca.py](app/security/ca.py),
[app/services/enrollment.py](app/services/enrollment.py),
[app/services/provisioning.py](app/services/provisioning.py),
[app/api/routers/enrollment.py](app/api/routers/enrollment.py),
[app/api/routers/checkin.py](app/api/routers/checkin.py), mTLS dependency in
[app/api/deps.py](app/api/deps.py). 86 tests passing.

#### Decisions taken during implementation

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D21 | Enrollment token stored as SHA-256 hash; plaintext returned once at creation | A database dump yields no usable enrollment credential. Provisioning payloads are returned alongside it, since they embed the secret. |
| D22 | EC P-256 throughout, RSA CSRs rejected | Native to Android Keystore and StrongBox, and far cheaper on the handshake every check-in performs. |
| D23 | The CSR's subject is discarded; the server builds the certificate subject itself | A CSR's subject is attacker-controlled. Only the public key is taken, after verifying the CSR signature for proof of possession. |
| D24 | Re-enrollment matches on **serial number** and re-adopts the existing device row | A wipe plus KME re-enroll is routine. A second row would orphan the device's history and silently drop the group membership driving its policy stack. Prior certificates are revoked on re-enroll. |
| D25 | Revocation is a `revoked_at` column checked during auth, not a CRL or OCSP responder | At 50-500 devices a database check is simpler to operate and strictly more current than a periodically published list. |
| D26 | Token group/tag scoping is **additive**, never replacing membership | Enrolling with a second token should add to a device's stack, not silently reset it. |
| D27 | `UtcDateTime` type decorator normalizes all timestamps to aware UTC | Postgres returns aware datetimes, SQLite naive ones; comparing them raises. Fixing it in the type removes a dialect-dependent landmine from every expiry check. |

#### Deployment prerequisite

mTLS terminates at the **reverse proxy**, which forwards the verified certificate in
`x-ssl-client-cert`. The app independently re-verifies issuer, signature, validity
window, and revocation — but possession of the private key is proven only by the TLS
handshake at the proxy. **That proxy must strip the header from inbound requests, and
the app must never be exposed directly.** Not yet enforced in code; see R7.

### ✅ Chunk 3 — Desired-state check-in protocol (COMPLETE)

The piece that makes the offline story real. A device dark for three weeks wakes,
receives one declarative desired state, and converges — rather than replaying an
ordered backlog it cannot safely reorder.

1. **Desired-state document** — a device-facing projection of the effective policy,
   stripped of provenance and conflicts. Admins get the "why"; devices get only what
   they must act on.
2. **Ed25519 bundle signing** — a signing key separate from the device CA, with
   canonical JSON serialization so the signature is reproducible byte-for-byte. The
   agent receives the public key at enrollment. Cheap now, and it is what makes a
   future LAN-relay or sneakernet delivery path possible without redesign (D9).
3. **Transient command queue** — `REBOOT`, `LOCK`, `WIPE`, `LOCATE`, `SCREENSHOT`,
   `CLEAR_APP_DATA`. Each with a TTL, delivered at-least-once and idempotent, expired
   rather than delivered when stale.
4. **Full check-in endpoint** — device sends its `state_version` and results; server
   returns the desired state **only when it has changed**, plus live commands and a
   jittered next-check-in hint to avoid a thundering herd.
5. **Convergence reporting** — devices report the version they actually applied and
   any failures. `Device.acked_state_version` separates "the server has v7" from
   "the device is running v7", which is the distinction a fleet dashboard lives on.
6. **Admin endpoints** — enqueue and inspect commands, view a device's desired state
   and convergence status.
7. **Tests.**

**Exit criteria met.** All of it, with 121 tests passing.

Delivered: [app/security/bundle.py](app/security/bundle.py),

[app/services/commands.py](app/services/commands.py),
[app/api/routers/checkin.py](app/api/routers/checkin.py),
[app/api/routers/commands.py](app/api/routers/commands.py).

#### Decisions taken during implementation

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D28 | `Device.acked_state_version` is tracked separately from `state_version` | "The server has v7" and "the device is running v7" are different claims. Conflating them is how a console reports compliance it never verified. The gap between them *is* the fleet's convergence lag. |
| D29 | The signed bundle contains **no timestamp or nonce** — it is deterministic per `(device, state_version)` | Because `state_version` moves exactly when values move (D17), the same version always yields byte-identical JSON and the same signature. That makes a bundle a cacheable, relayable artifact, which is the entire point of signing independently of TLS (D9). Per-response data lives in the envelope. |
| D30 | The desired state is a **projection**: values only, no provenance, no policy names, no conflicts | Admins need the "why"; devices do not. Shipping it would put the fleet's policy structure and group topology on every tablet, including any that gets lost. |
| D31 | Commands are delivered **at-least-once** and must be idempotent; staleness is enforced **on read** | A device that dies mid-execution must get the command again — at-most-once silently drops actions on exactly the intermittent links this design exists for. Expiring on read means no window where a device collects a command the console already considers dead. |
| D32 | TTL defaults vary by command type | A `LOCATE` from three weeks ago answers a question nobody is still asking (6h); a `WIPE` on a lost device stays worth executing as long as it might reappear (30d). |
| D33 | The bundle signing key is separate from the device CA key | Different job, different blast radius, different rotation cadence. Rotating the bundle key re-signs bundles; rotating the CA key invalidates every device identity. |
| D34 | Command results are matched against `(device_id, command_id)`, never the id alone | Otherwise one enrolled device could acknowledge — and thereby cancel — another device's pending wipe. |
| D35 | `alembic/script.py.mako` pre-imports `Text` and `app.db.base`; new NOT NULL columns need an explicit `server_default` | Autogenerate emits both bare `Text()` and `app.db.base.UtcDateTime` without importing them, and infers no server default from a Python-side default — so a generated migration would `NameError`, or fail on Postgres against a table that already has rows. Verified by migrating a seeded database. |

#### Deferred

FCM push is **not implemented**. Devices poll on a jittered ~15 min interval, which
is correct but means a command waits up to that long. FCM was always specified as a
latency optimization only (D7), never a correctness dependency — adding it later
changes no protocol, only how quickly a device notices.

### ✅ Chunk 4 — Artifact store and APK pipeline (COMPLETE)

Everything a device downloads, addressed by content hash. The server understands
what it is being handed rather than trusting the uploader's word for it.

1. **Content-addressed storage** — sha256-keyed blobs behind a storage interface,
   with a sharded local-filesystem backend. S3/MinIO slots in behind the same
   interface later without touching callers.
2. **Binary manifest (AXML) parser** — Android's `AndroidManifest.xml` is compiled
   binary XML, so package name, version code, and SDK levels cannot be read without
   decoding it. Resource-id fallback for APKs whose attribute name strings are empty.
3. **Signature extraction** — APK Signing Block v2/v3, falling back to the v1
   PKCS#7 block in `META-INF`. Modern APKs are frequently v2-only, so v1-only
   parsing would fail on exactly the builds we care about.
4. **Upload pipeline** — inspect, then **unpack XAPK/APKS server-side** into base +
   splits + OBB as separate content-addressed artifacts (D13), so the device opens
   one `PackageInstaller` session and writes parts it already has hashes for.
5. **Models and admin API** — packages, versions, files; upload, list, delete.
   **Signature pinning enforced at upload**: a new version whose signing certificate
   differs from the installed one *will* fail on device, so reject it here where the
   error is legible.
6. **Device-facing download** — mTLS, `Range` support for resumable transfer over
   bad links, and desired-state integration so a required app carries the hashes and
   sizes the agent needs to fetch and verify.
7. **Tests** — including a synthetic APK builder (real AXML, real v2 signing block)
   so the parsers are tested against actual binary structures.

**Exit criteria:** an APK or XAPK can be uploaded, is correctly identified, has its
signing certificate extracted, is stored content-addressed with splits separated,
is rejected if it would break signature pinning, and can be resumably downloaded by
an enrolled device that found it in its desired state.

**Exit criteria met**, with 168 tests passing and a full end-to-end run against the
Docker stack: an XAPK uploaded, unpacked into base + split + OBB, resolved into a
device's desired state, and downloaded over mTLS via interrupted-then-resumed range
requests with every hash verifying.

Delivered: [app/artifacts/](app/artifacts/) (storage, `axml`, `apk`, `bundles`),
[app/services/packages.py](app/services/packages.py),
[app/api/routers/packages.py](app/api/routers/packages.py),
[app/api/routers/artifacts.py](app/api/routers/artifacts.py),
[tests/apk_fixtures.py](tests/apk_fixtures.py).

**Bonus delivered:** the v2 signing certificate hash *is*
`PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM`, base64url-encoded. Uploading the
agent APK now returns it directly, unblocking the QR provisioning payloads that were
withheld in Chunk 2. Set it as `TAKMDM_AGENT_SIGNATURE_CHECKSUM` once the agent
exists (Chunk 5).

#### Decisions taken during implementation

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D36 | AXML and signing-block parsers written by hand rather than depending on androguard | androguard is a large malware-analysis framework; this needs a few hundred lines of well-specified format handling. Tested against synthetic APKs built with real binary structures, not mocks. |
| D37 | Signature extraction tries **v2/v3 before v1** | Apps targeting modern SDK levels are routinely signed v2-only with no `META-INF` block at all, so a v1-first (or v1-only) implementation fails on exactly the builds this fleet cares about. |
| D38 | `state_version` tracks resolved **apps** as well as policy values | Uploading a new build changes what a device must do without changing a single word of policy. Comparing values alone would leave the fleet on the old version indefinitely. |
| D39 | A catalog change invalidates **every** device's cache | Working out precisely which devices reference a package means re-resolving every stacked policy. A blanket flag is cheaper at this fleet size and cannot miss one — and costs nothing spurious, since the recompute only bumps `state_version` where the resolved state actually moved. |
| D40 | Splits are classified by the manifest's `split` attribute, never by filename | Archives whose parts were renamed would otherwise be misclassified, and the base APK picked at random. |
| D41 | Artifact download is authorized by **enrollment**, not per-device | The digest is unguessable and the content is something an operator chose to publish. Scoping per device would also defeat the deduplication the store is built on. |
| D42 | Artifact deletion is reference-counted across versions | Two versions sharing an unchanged OBB must not have it deleted out from under one of them. |
| D43 | `refresh` returns the stored payload, not the resolver's object | Found by test: the resolver knows nothing about resolved apps, so returning its object silently dropped them on any cache miss. |

### Later chunks (sketch — to be detailed at approval time)

| # | Chunk | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | Kotlin agent | Device Owner baseline, reconciler loop, `PackageInstaller`, file push |
| 6 | Knox layer | `OemPolicyApplier`, KSP restriction-bundle generation, KPE licensing, SDK fallbacks |
| 7 | TAK pack | ATAK policy type: data packages, `.pref` files, plugin sets, cert enrollment |
| 8 | Admin UI | Policy builder, stacking view, fleet dashboard |
| 9 | Offline / LAN relay | Only if required — D9 keeps the door open |

---

## Open questions / risks

| # | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is an app-op, not a runtime permission — `setPermissionGrantState` does not grant it. Blocks arbitrary `/sdcard` writes and OBB placement. Confirmed workaround is `adb shell appops set`, which does not scale. Knox `ApplicationPolicy` may cover it on these devices — **unverified**. | **Open. Validate on real hardware before Chunk 5** — highest-value early experiment. |
| R2 | OBB placement for XAPKs inherits R1 | Open |
| R3 | Knox partner application pending — gates KME and KPE | Tracking; AOSP path must not depend on it |
| R4 | `INTERSECT` on app allowlists is correct but counter-intuitive | Make configurable per policy; show resulting set before publish |
| R5 | Mixed SoC vendors (Qualcomm XCover6 Pro / MediaTek Tab S10+) on One UI 8 | Test every firmware-level behavior on **both** models |
| R6 | **Android 16 Advanced Protection Mode** disables "install unknown apps", blocking sideloading. User-toggleable, and Android Enterprise policy control over it does not arrive until **Android 17**, so it cannot be suppressed by policy on this fleet. Device Owner installs via `PackageInstaller` hold system install privilege and *should* be unaffected — **unverified**. | **Open. Test alongside R1** — if DO install is affected, it invalidates the whole delivery model. |
| R7 | mTLS header trust: nothing in code stops the app being exposed directly, where a copied certificate in `x-ssl-client-cert` would authenticate without the private key | **Partly mitigated.** A reference nginx config now ships in [docker/nginx/nginx.conf](docker/nginx/nginx.conf) — it always overwrites the header, so a forged one is stripped, and rejects uncertified requests to `/api/v1/device/` at the edge. `scripts/dev_enroll.py` verifies both behaviours on every run, and demonstrates the direct port accepting the forged header. **Still open in code:** the app does not refuse to start when no trusted proxy is configured. |
| R8 | CA private key is stored unencrypted at `pki/ca.key` (mode 0600, gitignored). Anyone holding it can mint a device identity. | **Open.** Acceptable on a single trusted host where the DB is equally exposed; move behind a KMS/HSM before that stops being true. |
| Q1 | ~~Which Samsung models / One UI versions?~~ | ✅ **Answered** — see device matrix |
| Q2 | ~~Existing ATAK deployment to integrate with?~~ | ✅ **Answered** — no upstream integration; ATAK server is configured **on the EUD**, so the TAK pack is pure config push (Chunk 7) |

### Retired

- **Minimum installable `targetSdk`** — Android 16 holds at **API 24**, unchanged from
  Android 15 (it did not increment). Normal APKs including ATAK clear this easily.
  Not a blocker; the server should still validate `targetSdk >= 24` at upload so the
  failure is legible there rather than as `INSTALL_FAILED_DEPRECATED_SDK_VERSION` on device.

---

## Changelog

- **2026-08-30** — Requirements gathered; operating envelope decided (offline-tolerant,
  50-500 devices, generic core + TAK pack); architecture written; Chunk 1 planned.
- **2026-08-30** — Device matrix confirmed (XCover6 Pro `SM-G736U1`, Tab S10+
  `SM-X828U`, both One UI 8 / Android 16). Q1 closed. Retired the `targetSdk` concern
  (Android 16 holds at API 24). Added R6 (Advanced Protection Mode) and reframed R5
  around mixed SoC vendors. Corrected the Knox SDK deprecation rationale behind D11.
- **2026-08-30** — Q2 closed: ATAK server is configured on the EUD, no upstream
  integration needed.
- **2026-08-31** — **Chunk 4 complete.** 168 tests passing, plus an end-to-end run
  against the Docker stack. Hand-written AXML and APK-signing-block parsers, so the
  server reads identity, version, and signing certificate out of an upload rather
  than trusting the uploader. Signature pinning and the API 24 `targetSdk` floor are
  enforced at upload, where the error is legible, instead of failing opaquely on a
  tablet. XAPKs unpack server-side into content-addressed base/split/OBB parts, and
  device download supports `Range` so an interrupted transfer resumes. Uploading the
  agent APK now yields the provisioning checksum that had blocked QR payloads.
- **2026-08-31** — **Local Docker stack** added (out of band, at user request):
  Postgres + API + nginx mTLS terminator, with a one-shot PKI init because nginx
  must read the device CA at startup. All three migrations verified against real
  Postgres, not just the SQLite suite. `scripts/dev_enroll.py` simulates a device
  end to end and verifies the bundle signature with an independent canonical-JSON
  implementation — the contract the Kotlin agent must match. R7 partly mitigated.
- **2026-08-31** — **Chunk 3 complete.** 121 tests passing. Desired-state check-in
  over mTLS: signed Ed25519 bundles sent only when the state changed, a TTL'd
  at-least-once command queue, and convergence tracking that separates server intent
  from device reality. Caught three migration defects before they shipped —
  autogenerate emitted `Text()` and `app.db.base.UtcDateTime` without importing
  either, and added NOT NULL columns with no `server_default`, which fails on
  Postgres against a table with existing rows. Fixed the Alembic template so the
  import half cannot recur (D35).
- **2026-08-30** — **Chunk 2 complete.** 86 tests passing. Device identity is a
  hardware-backed EC P-256 keypair with an mTLS client certificate from an internal
  CA; enrollment tokens are hashed at rest and scope a device into its groups/tags so
  it arrives with its policy stack already resolved. Added R7 (mTLS header trust) and
  R8 (CA key at rest). Fixed a dialect-dependent timestamp comparison bug with a
  `UtcDateTime` type decorator (D27).
- **2026-08-30** — **Chunk 1 complete.** 58 tests passing. Two caching bugs found and
  fixed by the tests before review: (a) invalidation deleted the cache row, destroying
  the baseline that distinguishes a real change from a cosmetic one, so every
  invalidation bumped `state_version` and would have woken the whole fleet on a
  no-op republish; (b) a never-computed device baselined at `None` rather than `{}`,
  so its first read bumped `state_version` spuriously. Both are now D15/D16.
